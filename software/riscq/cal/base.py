"""Shared calibration infrastructure (spec 06 §1, spec 08 §6 batched cut-over).

Every calibration runs its whole sweep as ONE batched run on the core (riscq.cal.kernels): the kernel
COMPUTES the swept knob on-core from a scalar sweep descriptor (a Q16 or int pair — spec 09; the input
Arrays are gone), walking it on a FIXED-period grid whose idle head is the T1 relax reset (the model
has no auto-reset, spec-M4 B0), so every readout lands at the same time-referenced demod-LO phase. The
demod carrier's discrimination phase (measured by ReadoutCalibration) is baked into the readout tables;
firing the demod IS the readout (its `dur` is the integration window). This module holds the batch
composers:
  - batches / seconds / relax_batches — the physical-units boundary (spec 13 §2: the Config and the
    calibration knobs are Hz / seconds / normalized amp; codes and batches are derived HERE),
  - gate_pulse / prep / x90_vz — the Config's own gate envelopes, qcal's two |1> preps (spec 13 §4)
    and the X90's virtual-Z frame bracket (spec 13 §7),
  - readout_tables / demod_table — the ro-drive + demod-carrier table pair (amp / env / phase / delay),
  - grid_period / batch_timeout — the host-computed fixed period + poll timeout,
  - sweep_q16 — the (x0q, dxq) Q16 sweep descriptor + the exact int x-axis the kernel realizes,
  - population / sweep_counts / rerun_counts — a params-only counts-mode sweep/rerun of ALL requested
    cores in one run, returning {q: |1> population P} (spec 13 §8 simultaneous multi-qubit),
  - acquire_shots — a per-prep raw-mode capture of all cores, returning {q: one prep state's IQ shots}.
