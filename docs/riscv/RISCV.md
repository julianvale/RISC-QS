# RISC-V core — the riscq RV32I control core

**Source:** [`src/riscq/riscv/`](../../src/riscq/riscv/) · **Package:** `riscq.riscv` · **Type:** plugin-on-a-host core

The control processor at the heart of the project's signal-processing SoC: a single-issue,
in-order, pipelined **RV32I** core in **SpinalHDL**, with an **optional Zmmul** (multiply-only) extension.
It is built **from scratch** following VexiiRiscv's plugin + pipeline *patterns*
(`ext/VexiiRiscv`) but deliberately stripped of its generality (no multi-lane, no RVC aligner,
no MMU/PMP, no OoO machinery). It runs on Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ `xczu49dr-ffvf1760-2-e`
and closes timing at **~590 MHz post-route OOC** on the `-2` part (with M, ~508 MHz; the
multiply unit is the binder).

This file is the per-core overview: the architecture, the verification approach, the durable
gotchas, and an index into the per-plugin reference docs. The core measured against the RISC-Q
reference design is in [RISC-Q-COMPARISON.md](RISC-Q-COMPARISON.md).

CPU-internal code lives under `riscq.riscv`; the signal peripherals and SoC fabric built around
the core live in sibling subpackages of `riscq` (see [`../soc/`](../soc/), [`../dsp/`](../dsp/)).

## Design philosophy

Correctness and clean design come first; **fmax is a soft, best-effort constraint** (see the
project [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md)). A feature is done when it passes a self-checking
SpinalSim *and* per-instruction RVLS/Spike lock-step. Each ISA extension is its own optional
`FiberPlugin` gated behind a `RiscqParam` flag, so the base RV32I core stays minimal and a
config can ship without it — extension logic is never hard-wired into the RV32I datapath.

## Architecture

**Plugins on a host.** Every feature is a `FiberPlugin` (`spinal.lib.misc.plugin`). The
toplevel [`Riscq`](../../src/riscq/riscv/Riscq.scala) owns only a fiber `Database` (for shared
constants) and a `PluginHost` (on which plugins register and elaborate); it generates no
hardware itself. `Riscq(param.plugins())` assembles a configured core — see
[RiscqParam](RiscqParam.md) for how the plugin list is built.

**One unified pipeline chain.** [`PipelinePlugin`](pipeline.md) is a *single* `CtrlLink` chain
(`spinal.lib.misc.pipeline`). A feature plugin grabs `pp.ctrl(i)` and injects logic with
`new pp.ctrl(i).Area { ... }`. We use **one** chain rather than VexiiRiscv's three (fetch /
decode / execute) because riscq has no RVC aligner and no multi-lane execute, so a single
in-order chain is the simpler exact fit.

**Stage partitioning.** Stage indices are derived from [`RiscqParam`](RiscqParam.md) and
partition the chain into **Fetch → Decode → Execute**. With the defaults:

| stage | index | role |
|---|---|---|
| `pcAt`        | 0 | PC injected; fetch fork issues the iBus `Get`; BTB / GShare read |
| `fetchDataAt` | 1 | instruction word joined (`Fetch.WORD` written) |
| `decodeAt`    | 2 | decode: register fields, immediate type, control payloads |
| `regReadAt`   | 3 | register-file read + forwarding + SRC mux; branch `pc+imm` precompute |
| `executeAt`   | 4 | ALU / branch-resolve / LSU / CSR / multiply |
| `regWriteAt` = `jumpAt` | 5 | rd write-back; branch redirect + flush |

Bumping a `RiscqParam` index inserts a registered stage (exactly as VexiiRiscv's
`aluAt`/`jumpAt`/`forkAt`); raising `fetchLatency` slides the whole back end down in lock-step.

**Shared constants.** A fiber `Database` in [`Global`](../../src/riscq/riscv/Global.scala) is
published once by [`RiscqPlugin`](../../src/riscq/riscv/RiscqPlugin.scala) (`Global.XLEN`,
`Global.FETCH_PC_WIDTH`, `Global.PC_BASE`, …). Reads **block** until the value is set, so plugin
elaboration order doesn't matter.

**Injecting logic — the elaboration protocol.** A plugin holds `pp.elaborationLock` (via
`retains(...)`) from its `during setup` until it has registered all its stages; `PipelinePlugin`
then connects every link and calls `Builder` once. See [pipeline.md](pipeline.md).

## Build & run

```bash
mill runMain riscq.riscv.RiscqGen          # generate Verilog (Riscq.v)
mill runMain riscq.riscv.sim.FetchSim      # a SpinalSim testbench (Verilator)
mill runMain riscq.riscv.sim.RvTestSim     # all rv32ui-p-* ELF tests (add a name to run one)
mill runMain riscq.riscv.bench.PathAnalysis # static longest-path + fanout report (pre-synth)
mill runMain riscq.riscv.bench.VivadoBench  # Vivado synth: est. fmax + top critical paths
```

(`mill` is on the `PATH`.) The DUT-agnostic
analysis/bench engines live in [`riscq.bench`](../bench/); the `riscq.riscv.bench.*` objects are
thin entry points that feed the core into them.

### Worktree / subagent environment

An isolated git worktree (`.claude/worktrees/<id>`) contains only tracked files — the `ext/`
submodules are **not** present. Once per worktree session:

1. **`mill` is on the `PATH`** and auto-finds `build.mill` in the worktree cwd:
   ```bash
   mill runMain riscq.riscv.RiscqGen
   ```
2. **Symlink the three `ext/` dependencies** (build fails without them):
   ```bash
   ln -s /config/build/agentic-rv-dev/ext/VexiiRiscv ext/VexiiRiscv
   ln -s /config/build/agentic-rv-dev/ext/rvls       ext/rvls
   rmdir ext/SpinalHDL && ln -s /config/build/agentic-rv-dev/ext/SpinalHDL ext/SpinalHDL
   ```
   **Do NOT commit these symlinks.** Stage only `src/riscq/riscv/...` files explicitly; never
   `git add -A` (the `ext/SpinalHDL` type-change shows as a ` T` gitlink and must stay unstaged).
3. **Edit the worktree copy**, not `/config/build/agentic-rv-dev/...`. Reading the shared tree
   for context is fine — just write to the worktree path.
4. **RVLS lock-step**: force it on with `RISCQ_RVLS=1` (off with `RISCQ_RVLS=0`). Confirm the run
   prints `RVLS/Spike per-instruction lock-step: ON`. Auto-enables when
   `ext/rvls/build/apps/rvls.so` is reachable (via the symlink above).

## Verification

**Self-checking SpinalSim first → RVLS/Spike lock-step + Konata later.** riscq does **not** depend on
the VexiiRiscv build module: `build.mill` compiles the `rvls.spinal.*` Spike-lockstep bindings straight
from the `ext/rvls` submodule, and the two small support pieces are vendored under `src/` —
`riscq.riscv.test.konata.Backend` (the Konata trace writer) and `spinal.lib.misc.Elf` (the jelf-based
ELF loader). `SparseMemory` and the Tilelink `MemoryAgent` come from SpinalHDL proper.

**Per-instruction Spike lock-step** ([`sim/RvTestSim`](../../src/riscq/riscv/sim/RvTestSim.scala)
+ [`RiscqProbe`](RiscqProbe.md) → `rvls.spinal.TraceBackend`) auto-runs when
`ext/rvls/build/apps/rvls.so` exists (`make` in `ext/rvls`). Spike runs **machine-only**
(RV32I/M), so the probe must `addRegion` (RVLS faults outside declared regions) and `xlenExtend`
rd writes, and rvls is **patched** for the WARL-stub CSRs ([`patches/`](../../patches/README.md))
— `ext/rvls` is a submodule; re-apply + `make` if it resets. All `rv32ui-p-*` (and, with
`withMul`, the `rv32um-p-*` mul group) ELFs pass under lock-step.

## Gotchas (durable)

- **Instantiate plugins inside elaboration**, never at an `App`'s top level — doing it before
  `SimConfig.compile{ Riscq(...) }` throws `GlobalData ... null`. In sims, reach a plugin from
  the elaborated DUT via `dut.host[PluginType]`, then `plugin.logic.<member>` for `simPublic`
  signals. (`simPublic` needs `import spinal.core.sim._`.)
- **`CtrlLink.forkStream` fires on *bus-accept* (downstream `ready`), not on node-advance.** With
  one outstanding request and no reorder buffer, a fork at an upstream stage can issue the *next*
  request while the current instruction is held by a downstream stall, and the response corrupts
  the held slot. Two valid answers: issue the `Get` *at the consuming stage* (the
  [LSU](LsuPlugin.md), single outstanding), or fork upstream but tag each `Get` with a **per-id
  reorder buffer** so responses demux by id (the [fetch](FetchPlugin.md), multi-outstanding, to
  sustain IPC = 1 across memory latency).
- **A get-only Tilelink bus (`withDataA=false`) has null `a.mask`/`a.data`/`a.corrupt`** — don't
  drive them; `size` alone says "one word". See [MemBus](MemBus.md).
- **Vivado synthesis (`VivadoBench`/`VivadoRouteBench`) is fully deterministic and
  Verilog-order-insensitive** — zero run-to-run spread; signal-declaration order has no effect.
- **The two fmax binders are textbook and route-dominated** (not logic-depth-dominated): the ALU
  result→operand forward loop and the `pcReg → predicted-target → pcReg` redirect loop. On FPGA
  ~68% of the critical path is interconnect, so deeper-pipeline levers buy far less than FO4 math
  predicts; the timing levers in [RiscqParam](RiscqParam.md) attack routing/placement, not depth.
- **Trust the mill build, not IDE diagnostics** — metals lags after new files/imports.
- **Only reuse VexiiRiscv/RVLS *test* code**; never import VexiiRiscv *hardware* into riscq.
- Conventions: 2-space indent (scalafmt), pipeline payloads `UPPER_CASE`, parameterize widths via
  [`RiscqParam`](RiscqParam.md) (never hard-code).
