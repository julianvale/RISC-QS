# SOC_TIPS — gotchas & solutions building the `riscq.soc` SoC

Hard-won, non-obvious issues building the `riscq.soc` SoC. Each entry is **symptom → cause → fix**. Read
this before touching `riscq.soc` / the `tilelink.fabric` glue or writing a SoC-level SpinalSim.

---

## 1. `tilelink.fabric` wiring

### 1.1 Core → fabric bridge (`RiscqFiber`)
The agentic `FetchPlugin`/`LsuPlugin` already expose real Tilelink masters (`iBus`/`dBus`), so the
adapter is just (no `CachelessBusToTilelink` double-bridge):
```scala
node.m2s.forceParameters(master.p.node.m)          // master.p = BusParameter; .node.m = M2sParameters
node.s2m.supported.load(S2mSupport.none())
node.bus.component.rework(node.bus << master)      // rework: the node's bus Handle loads in its own Fiber thread
```
`node` is `Node.down()` (master-only). Do **not** `setAsDirectionLess()` the master — it's already an
IO of the child `Riscq` component, so `<<` is a normal parent-reads-child-output connection.

### 1.2 Fan-out offsets are RELATIVE to each region bus
Symptom: `scala.NotImplementedError` in `AddressMapping.withOffsetInvert` / `NeverMapping` during a
Node decoder's `getMemoryTransfers`. Cause: a slave connected `at <absolute host address> of regionBus`
when the WidthAdapter/decoder already rebased that region to 0. Fix: connect `at (i * stride) of
regionBus`, not `at (regionBase + i*stride)`. (Absolute offsets are only for connections directly off
the top `hostBus`.)

### 1.3 `beatMax must be 1` — it's about `blockSize`, not bursts
The word-wide on-chip memory fibers (`TileLinkMem{ReadWrite,Write}Logic`) assert `p.beatMax == 1`.
- **`blockSize` too large** for a *narrow* fiber is NOT the problem — each fiber's **decoder restricts
  the transfer size down to what that fiber supports**, so a 32-bit memory stays single-beat even with a
  big `blockSize`.
- **`blockSize` too small** (e.g. 4) for a *wide* fiber **is** the problem: the host can't reach the wide
  word, the WidthAdapter negotiates `sizeBytes = 0`, and `beatMax = (0+dataBytes-1)/dataBytes = 0 ≠ 1`.
- **Rule:** set `Axi4ToTilelinkFiber(blockSize = …)` ≥ the **widest** on-chip memory word in bytes
  (e.g. a 512-bit pulse-envelope line ⇒ `blockSize = 64`). The reference used 32 only because its widest
  word was 256-bit.
- **Diagnose** by printing the failing fiber's `p.dataWidth` / `p.sizeBytes` in the assert message.

### 1.4 Wide memories need a `WidthAdapter`; narrow ones connect directly
A 32-bit host write into a 512-bit envelope line is a *masked wide-word* write done by an upsizing
`tilelink.fabric.WidthAdapter` (16 partial host writes fill one line). Put the adapter on the pulse-mem
and readout-buffer (`robs`) paths; the 32-bit instruction memory connects straight to `hostBus`.
(Connecting a wide fiber directly to a 32-bit `Node` gives `sizeBytes = 0` — see 1.3.)

---

## 2. SpinalSim — `tilelink.sim.MasterAgent`

### 2.1 The phantom-`A` NPE (the single biggest time-sink)
Symptom: `NullPointerException: ...MasterAgent.callbackOnAtoD()[...source()] is null`, often with a
spurious `D src=1 bytes=8` printed before any `A`. Cause: a `MasterBus`'s `bus.a.*` is **undriven (X)**
until the agent's `StreamDriverOoo` runs its first `onSamplings` (at the first clock edge). During reset
the slave sees X-valued `a.valid`, latches a **phantom request**, and its response fires into an
unregistered callback. Fixes (use either/both):
- **Create the `MasterAgent` before the first clock edge** (before any `waitSampling`) so its driver
  holds `a.valid` low from edge 1; **or** drive `dut.<masterBus>.node.bus.a.valid #= false` at t=0
  before `forkStimulus`.
- It can also manifest **without an NPE** as a *garbage pulse*: the phantom fire reads an
  **uninitialized** pulse-table `dur` → loads the duration counter with garbage → a long spurious pulse
  from t=0. So **also reset the pulse table to 0** (`Reg(...) init ….getZero`) so a stray fire reads a
  benign `dur = 0`.
- In the real SoC the CPU/AXI master holds the bus low through reset, so none of this arises — it is a
  bus-master *sim-harness* artifact.

### 2.2 `MasterAgent` needs real `IdAllocator` + `IdCallback`
`new MasterAgent(bus, cd)(idAllocator)` — pass `implicit val idAllocator = new IdAllocator(DebugId.width)`
and `implicit val idCallback = new IdCallback`. Passing `null` works for the **slave** `MemoryAgent`
(`SimMem`) but the **master** OoO driver needs them to match responses to requests.

### 2.3 Driving a `SlaveFactory` register map
- `factory.write(reg, addr, bitOffset = 16)` ⇒ the field lives in bus bits `[16,32)`; write it with
  `agent.putInt(src, addr, (v & 0xFFFF) << 16)`.
- Reading a **halting** register (e.g. `res` gated by `res.valid`): `agent.getInt` simply **blocks**
  until the slave un-halts — which is exactly the CPU spin-wait behaviour you want to test.
- Space writes out a couple of cycles if you ever see flakiness, but the root cause of "weird" behaviour
  is almost always 2.1, not back-to-back timing.

### 2.4 Lead-time `TimedQueue` scheduling in a sim
Hold `io.time = 0` while doing all the TL writes (the pushed entries sit in the queues, since the
wrap-safe geq pop only fires once `time ≥ startTime − lead`), then ramp `io.time` and capture. The
hold-then-ramp is safe because the pop test is level-based.

## 3. SpinalSim — reset, clock domains, signal access

### 3.1 "Is this register actually reset?"
A reg whose value **varies across netlist edits** (e.g. after adding a `simPublic`) is **uninitialized /
random**, not reset. A reg that is **deterministically its init value** is reset. `cd.forkStimulus(period)`
only drives reset **if `cd.hasResetSignalSim`** and asserts it for `resetCycles` (default 16). **Do not**
mix manual `cd.assertReset()/deassertReset()` with `forkStimulus` — both drive the reset signal and
fight, deasserting it early.

### 3.2 Read internal signals via `simPublic`, not `out`
Wiring `val dbg = out(...); dbg := core.deep.signal` is a **HIERARCHY VIOLATION**. Call
`core.deep.signal.simPublic()` during elaboration and read `dut.core.deep.signal.toBigInt` in the sim.

### 3.3 `#=` then immediate read is stale
`sig #= v; sig.toBigInt` returns the **old** value (the assignment propagates on the next delta). Read
after a `waitSampling`, or just don't read what you just wrote.

### 3.4 Instantiate the DUT inside `compile{}`
`val dut0 = MyComp(); SimConfig.compile(dut0)` throws `GlobalData … null`. `compile` takes the component
**by name**: `SimConfig.compile(MyComp())`.

### 3.5 Two-clock SoC sims
Fork **both** domains (`dut.clockDomain` and the explicit `dut.dspCd`) at the **same period**; the
cross-domain `BufferCC`/fabric works when the clocks are aligned. Real CDC / multi-frequency clocking is
deferred to a later packaging pass (§7 of the plan).

### 3.6 `DualClockRam` is intentionally MULTIDRIVEN
One array, two clocked ports ⇒ Verilator errors `MULTIDRIVEN`. Any sim instantiating a `DualClockRam`
(directly or via the SoC) needs `SimConfig.addSimulatorFlag("-Wno-MULTIDRIVEN")`.

### 3.7 Backdoor-preloading a `Mem`
`DualClockRam.mem` is `Verilator.public` ⇒ `dut.<path>.mem.setBigInt(wordIndex, value)`. The address is
the **word index**, not a byte address.

---

## 4. Driving the qubit core without a CPU program

The shared batch-time `time` is `RegNext(refTime + timeOffset)` and `refTime` is gated by `riscqReset`
(same clock domain as the CPU). So:
- **To advance `time`** in a bus-driven sim you must **deassert `riscqReset`**, which also **runs the
  CPU**. Keep the CPU benign by backdoor-loading a 1-instruction self-loop — `jal x0, 0` = `0x6f` — into
  each core's instruction RAM word 0 (the reset vector `0x80000000`). It loops on the fetch bus and never
  touches `dBus`.
- **To inject RF-config writes** without software, add a **test-only second master** to each core's
  `dMemPortDec` (gated by a `withTest` flag, so the real SoC keeps the CPU as the sole `dBus` master).
  The self-looping CPU + the test `MasterAgent` share `dMemPortDec` through the fabric arbiter with no
  conflict, because the CPU is idle on `dBus`.

### 4.1 In the *full* SoC, release `riscqReset` by writing the host control block
Symptom: `time` stays **0** forever in a `PulseTableSoc` sim (debug prints `advancing: false`), and the
very next `MasterAgent.putInt` into the RF/control tree **hangs** (no `D` response). Cause: in the
toplevel, `riscqReset` is gated by `riscqResetHostCd`, a `factory.drive(...)`-backed register that has
**no init** (same as the reference) — so the cores **boot held in reset**: `refTime` never counts and the
whole `riscqCd` fabric (`dMemPortDec`, the control + RF slaves) never answers a TL request. Fix: the host
must **explicitly release reset over AXI**, exactly as the reference testbench does — write `0x01` (reset
up, hold) then `0x00` (reset down, release) to the host control block (`hostCtrlBase`, `riscqReset`@offset
0), then wait out the `BufferCC(5)+Delay(5)` CDC before scheduling anything. (A qubit-core sim with no
host control block doesn't hit this; it only appears once the host control block is in the loop.)

### 4.2 Checking the readout end-to-end in the SoC: assert *magnitude*, not bit-exact
Problem: a SoC-level "does the ADC reach the readout" test wants to drive `io.adc` and check the
integrated `real/imag` — but the integrated value depends on the **exact** phase the LO carrier and the
externally-driven ADC tone have *at the decoder input*, and those differ by the (constant but non-obvious)
bulk pipeline latency from `io.adc`/`io.time` through the converters/`adcBufs`/demod. Chasing that offset
to predict an exact `real`/`imag` is the deferred "absolute alignment" problem (plan §4).
- **Fix — drive a frequency-matched tone and assert on |z| = √(real²+imag²), VNA-style.** The carrier is
  `exp(iπ·(F·s + φ)/2^(w−1))` at sample index `s = adcN·t + k` (`F` the 16-bit freq code written to the
  demod fiber). Feed a real cosine at the **same `F`**, phase-locked to the SoC batch `time` (read
  `dut.riscqArea.time` in the ADC fork so the tone's frequency *exactly* matches the LO's, independent of
  the pipeline delay). Then the integral is `real ≈ C·cosΔ`, `imag ≈ C·sinΔ` for a **constant** unknown
  phase offset Δ — so **|z| ≈ C = (Aadc·Alo/2^(w−1))·(samples/2) is phase-invariant** and robustly large,
  while a **detuned** tone averages to ~0. Assert `|z|_matched ≫ |z|_detuned` (e.g. ratio ≥ 4×; observed
  ~36×). This needs **zero** knowledge of the pipeline latency.
- **No overflow surprise:** the demod product is `(a·b+½ulp)>>(w−1)` *resized to w bits* before the adder
  tree (`ComplexMul` output is `w`-wide, not `2w`), so the `accWidth`-bit accumulator only grows like
  `w + log2Up(adcN) + durWidth` — `accWidth = 32` is safe for any sane window.
- **Read it back over the real bus:** fire the demod (its slot `dur` is the window), wait past the
  window's opening, then read `res` (which **halts** until the integral settles), then `real`/`imag`. No
  `simPublic` on the decoder needed — go through the TL slave.
- **`io.adc` is a `slave Stream`** the SoC reads **combinationally** (it ignores `valid`); drive
  `.payload` (and `.valid` for tidiness), never `.ready` (the top drives it). Hold every ADC `payload` at
  0 from t=0 so the `robs` ADC-sum reduction never latches X before the readout part runs.

### 4.3 CPU-in-the-loop: build + backdoor-load a tiny program, let the core schedule the pulse
The faithful sign-off replaces the test-master writes with a RISC-V program (so `withTest = false` — the
CPU is the sole `dBus` master). Mechanics that bit:
- **Toolchain.** A working LLVM is at `/config/build/riscv-install/bin` (clang 20 targeting
  `riscv32-unknown-unknown-elf`, `ld.lld`). Build a bare-metal `.S` at the reset vector with
  `clang -target riscv32 -march=rv32i -mabi=ilp32 -mno-relax -nostdlib -static -Wl,-Ttext=0x80000000
  -Wl,-e,_start prog.S -o prog.elf`. **No GP/SP/runtime needed** for a pure-MMIO program (only `li`/`lw`/
  `sw`/`j`). The reset vector is `RiscqParam.resetVector = 0x80000000`; commit the `.elf` next to the `.S`.
- **This LLVM fork pads every instruction with three `nop`s** (a hazard-spacing feature for the RISC-Q
  core). Harmless for our interlocked core (it's RVLS-verified on un-padded ELFs) — don't fight it;
  it just costs a few cycles. `llvm-objdump -d` to sanity-check the `lui`/`addi` constants.
- **Every RF field is in bus bits [16,32)** (SlaveFactory `bitOffset = 16`), so the program stores
  `value << 16` — e.g. `li t2, 0x07080000 ; sw t2, 0x04(t1)` writes `freq = 1800`. The low 16 bits are 0
  so a bare `lui` suffices (no `addi`).
- **Load it** with `new Elf(file, 32).load(image, 0)` (`spinal.lib.misc.Elf` + `SparseMemory`), then
  `core.mem.mem.setBigInt(wordIdx, image.readInt(0x80000000 + 4*wordIdx))` for the program's word range
  (load a generous window, e.g. 256 words; the `j self` loop means anything past it is unreached). Put a
  `jal x0,0` (`0x6f`) in word 0 of the **other** cores so they idle.
- **Don't predict timing — poll.** After reset-release (§4.1) the CPU runs immediately; `simPublic` the
  core's `startTime` reg and spin until it's non-zero (proves the dBus reached the control block), then
  sweep `time` to `startTime + margin` and assert the DAC pulse exactly as the bus-driven SoC sim does. (Observed:
  the program finishes before the post-reset settle wait even completes — `startTime` is already set.)

---

## 5. Module / params gotchas

- **`PulseTableTerm` field widths** must match their destination `PulseGenerator.io` port widths
  (`durWidth ≠ dataWidth` is allowed) — `assignFromBits` requires equal widths. Parameterize each field.
- **`startTime` auto-advance staging (spec 09 B0) is beat-order — the staging is load-bearing.** Every fire
  adds the fired slot's `dur` to that buffer's `startTime`, applied the **beat after** the fire (the fired
  `outId`/`outParam` settle a cycle later). Two facts make the staging matter: (1) back-to-back
  `play()`/`fire()` calls really do produce **adjacent cmd beats** through the posted link, so an explicit
  `set_start` can land on the very beat after a fire — it must **win** over the increment (a
  `!explicitStartWrite` guard; `…fire(a); set_start(t)…` leaves `t`, not `t+dur_a`); (2) the export carries
  one `RegNext` (`io.startTime := RegNext(startTime)`), so — since a fired pulse reaches the `TimedQueue`
  push 2 cycles after its fire beat and the queues sample `startTime` **at push** — each fired pulse
  captures `startTime` **as of its own fire beat (pre-increment)** and back-to-back fires capture the
  running sum. The rejected alternative (increment when `outParamFlow.valid`, 2 beats late, no export stage)
  lets an intervening absolute `set_start` be corrupted (`fire@N, set_start@N+1, inc@N+2` → `t+dur`). The
  extra stage is uniform across buffers ⇒ absolute pulse timing is bit-identical for all existing software.
- **`ReadoutDecoder.accWidth`** is `require`-checked `≥ dataWidth + log2Up(batchSize) + maxWinLog2`, **and**
  must stay `≤ 32` to read the integral back in one TL word. The window length is the **demod pulse's
  `dur`** (16-bit field), so the bound is a *software* contract: the driver rejects a demod-table
  `dur > 2^maxWinLog2` (default 2^14) — hardware can no longer clamp it with a narrow field width.
- **Readout pacing (carrier-triggered decoder).** The demod carrier's `valid` is the decoder window
  ([specs/new-readout-decoder](../../specs/new-readout-decoder/README.md)); the decoder's `res.valid` is
  forwarded up as a **level** the sink mirrors, so `read_res` is **idempotent** (no arm, no consume).
  Freshness is a *software timing* contract: after firing the demod at `t`, `wait_until(t + RQ_RO_LEAD)`
  before `read_res` so the previous shot's still-held level has dropped (past `winStart`) — reading earlier
  returns the previous shot. Also keep ≥ 1 idle batch between consecutive demod windows (zero-gap windows
  have no falling edge and merge into one integral — and a fire *during* an open window extends it, since
  the generator's `dur` counter reloads).
- **The demod carrier DOES re-tune + re-play on-core** (spec 08 §2.2 / B1; debunks the
  `riscq/cal/readout.py` "can't be re-tuned + re-played on-core" folklore, which had no root cause and
  forced the VNA into a host loop). One program that `set_freq(demod, code)` + re-plays per point
  resolves the matched code (peak at 4× the DAC code) *element-for-element identically* to a host loop
  of one run per code (`software/tests/test_vna_retune.py`). **Requirement:** schedule each retuned play
  far enough ahead that the phasor-regen lead is covered — `set_freq` pushes the freq into the phasor
  queue against the buffer's *current* startTime, and the phasor regenerates `leadFreqP` (≈ linkPipe+52)
  cycles before it; a grid `period ≫ LEAD` between points covers this with margin (`init_pulse_params`
  anchoring startTime to `now()` up front makes the first regen due immediately — *wrap-safely*; see the
  next bullet for why it must be `now()`, not 0). The old failure was almost certainly a play issued too
  soon after the retune, not a HW limit.
- **`set_freq` against `startTime = 0` "sticks" on hardware (the `TimedQueue` wrap window).** *Symptom:*
  sweeping a carrier across reruns, the frequency intermittently doesn't change — sometimes a whole sweep
  reads back at one (stale) frequency; amplitude/phase sweeps never do this; co-sim never reproduces it.
  *Cause:* `set_freq` pushes the freq into the pulse-generator phasor/carrier `TimedQueue`s tagged with
  the buffer's *current* `startTime`, and the queue's due test `!(time + leadC1 − startTime).msb` is a
  SIGNED compare — only wrap-safe within ±2^31 of `io.time`. `io.time` (`refTime + timeOffset`) FREE-RUNS
  and is never reset (the drive-drop fix below), wrapping 2^32 every ~8.6 s. Scheduling against absolute
  `0` while `io.time` is in the upper half (≥ 2^31, ~half of every uptime cycle) reads as ~2^31 in the
  *future* ⇒ the entry never pops ⇒ the phasor regen never fires ⇒ the carrier holds its previous
  frequency. Co-sim starts `refTime` at 0 and never reaches 2^31 in a short run, so it always "works"
  there — the bug is hardware-only. Amplitude/phase are immune: they're pushed on `fire`, scheduled at the
  pulse's own `startTime = now()+LEAD` (always within `LEAD` of `io.time`, hence always in-window).
  *Fix:* schedule the freq against a near-`now()` time — `init_pulse_params` now does `set_start(ch,
  now())` (was `0`), which is bit-exact in co-sim (both due immediately when `time ≈ 0`) and correct on
  hardware, so every `init_pulse_params; set_freq` kernel (all of `riscq.cal.kernels`) is covered. A
  hand-written kernel that `set_freq`s *without* a preceding `init_pulse_params` must likewise anchor its
  `startTime` to `now()` (or the pulse's `t`), never 0. Deterministic repro without hardware: write
  `timeOffset ≥ 2^31` to the host control block so `io.time` lands in the upper half — the old
  `set_start(0)` schedule then fails while the `now()` schedule still tracks.
- *(Historical — the armed decoder, removed by the carrier-triggered rewrite.)* The old software-armed
  window had a startTime-before-`dur` ordering contract whose violation latched a stale previous-shot
  window that silently survived resets (`decStartTime` lived in `dspCd`); a matched readout then collapsed
  to a fixed fraction on every re-play, masquerading as "the carrier dies on re-fire" (commit `4e55a2c`).
  That bug class — not just the bug — is why the decoder is now triggered by the carrier itself.
- **A pulse un-drained at a run's end drops the NEXT run's drive** (the "multi-pulse batch corrupts the
  next run" folklore; spec 08 §3 / B0). **Symptom:** after a program schedules a drive pulse well in the
  future and returns before batch time reaches it, the *next* program's drive never reaches the DAC (the
  captured window is all-zero); a program that waits past its last pulse leaves the next run clean.
  **Cause:** each `PulseGenerator` parameter (amp/phase/env/dur) is a `TimedQueue` (async-read
  `StreamFifo`) that pops when `time ≥ startTime − lead`. The generators live in `dspCd`, which
  `riscqReset` does **not** reset. When `refTime` (hence batch `time`) was *also* zeroed at each run's
  reset, a leftover entry kept the previous run's large `startTime`, sat at the FIFO head "in the future,"
  and blocked every fresh entry queued behind it (FIFO order); `init_pulse_params` only clears the
  buffer's `startTime` register, it cannot drain the queues. **Fix:** make `refTime` **free-running** in
  `dspCd` — NOT reset by `riscqReset`, only by the external `dspRst` — so batch `time` is **monotonic
  across runs** (`PulseTableSoc.riscqArea`). A leftover entry then falls into the *past*, pops as `time`
  sweeps past its `startTime`, and drains on its own before the next run schedules anything, so runs are
  independent with no per-run queue flush and no software preamble. Software works in now()-relative time,
  so the ever-growing base is transparent. Repro: `software/tests/test_batch_drivedrop.py`
  (drained-vs-un-drained A/B pins it to the leftover entries).
- *(Folklore, retired — the warm-up row / "cold first readout".)* Every cal once discarded its first
  measurement ("the cold-decoder first read"; "absorbs the cold-first-readout verilator settle"), later
  batched as a discarded row 0 repeating point 0 (specs 08/09). It was never an analog/settle effect —
  Verilator is two-state and deterministic. The three real mechanisms behind bad early reads are all
  fixed: the armed decoder's never-reset `decStartTime` + arm-ordering (removed by the carrier-triggered
  rewrite — the first `res` read now HALTS until the first window's integral settles, sink `init False`),
  the un-drained timed-queue drive-drop (free-running `refTime`, above), and stale amp/phase in a fresh
  SoC's first window batches (the `LEAD = 96` contract, `map.py`). `test_batch.py::test_first_row_clean`
  pins it: a run's first window is bit-identical to later ones. [Spec 11](../../specs/software/11-remove-warmup.md)
  removed the row; first-read hygiene is a *timing* contract (`LEAD` / `wait_until(t + RQ_RO_LEAD)`),
  not a discarded measurement.
- *(Co-sim infra corollary.)* `riscq.sim.rtl.ensure_rtl` caches the generated `PulseTableSoc.v` on the
  **config-JSON hash only** — after editing the *RTL Scala* it returns the stale `.v`, so the co-sim
  silently tests the un-patched design. Delete `software/build/<name>/` (or its `rtl/.config.sha`) to
  force a regen before trusting a co-sim run after an RTL change.
- **Elaboration check for a fiber `Area`**: wrap it in a `Component` that supplies the clock domains and
  **stub host masters** (`MasterBus`) for its otherwise-dangling slave nodes (`iMemPortArb`,
  `pulseMemFiber.up`), else the fabric can't negotiate. Drive any init-only `Reg`s (e.g. `time := time +
  1`) to silence `UNASSIGNED REGISTER` errors.

---

## 6. Scala / build

- **A dual-clock SoC needs a custom two-clock XDC — the generic `riscq.bench.VivadoBench` engine only
  constrains `clk`.** That engine writes `create_clock … [get_ports clk]` and nothing else, so on the
  SoC it would leave the whole `dspClk` domain — the actual critical path — **unconstrained** (no WNS, a
  meaningless fmax). Write a SoC-specific bench (`riscq.soc.bench.PulseTableSocVivadoBench`) that emits its
  own XDC: tight `create_clock dspClk`, a loose `create_clock clk` at its real 100 MHz, and
  `set_clock_groups -asynchronous -group {dspClk} -group {clk}` so the `BufferCC` host↔dsp CDC paths are
  excluded (else they dominate WNS with a bogus cross-clock requirement). With the host clock loose it
  always meets, so the global WNS — hence the reported fmax — is the `dspClk` critical domain. Observed
  ~555 MHz (2-qubit, OOC synth), critical path **inside the RISC-V core**, not the DSP datapath. Reuse
  `VivadoBench.parse`/`Path` for the `report_timing` output; only the run + XDC differ.
- **`Map.collect` that yields a *tuple* rebuilds a `Map` — and silently de-dups keys.** A subtle,
  high-impact bug. `dacMap.collect { case ((c, ch), id) if id == dacId => (c, ch) }` returns `(c, ch)`
  2-tuples, so Scala builds a **`Map[c, ch]`**: two channels of the *same core* (gate `(0,0)` + readout
  `(0,1)`) **collide on key `c` and the gate is silently overwritten** — the pulse never reaches its DAC.
  **Symptom:** a DAC that should sum N channels takes the `pulses.size == 1` path; the Verilog shows only
  *one* channel feeding the DAC register (e.g. `_zz_…dacPayloads_8 <= {…dac_1_…re}`, no adder, no other
  channel anywhere). **Fix:** `dacMap.toList.collect { … }` — `.toList` first, so `.collect` runs on a
  `List` and returns a `List[(c,ch)]` with no key de-dup. (Same trap for any `collect`/`map` over a `Map`
  whose body returns a 2-tuple: force a `Seq`/`List` first, or `.iterator.collect{…}.toList`.)
- **Diagnosing "right input, zero output" datapaths:** when a probe shows a signal non-zero but its
  consumer's output is stuck (here: `core.dac(0)(0).re` = the pulse, but `io.dac(8)` = 0), **read the
  generated Verilog** (`grep` the output port back to its driver reg, then the reg's RHS). The netlist
  showed `dacPayloads_8` was fed by `dac_1` (not the summed `dac_0+dac_1`) — instantly localising the bug
  to the channel-selection logic rather than the (correct) `AdderTree`/`RegNext` datapath. Faster than
  adding more `simPublic` probes.
- **Scala 2.12 forbids `_` in numeric literals** (`0x0000_0064` is a parse error) — write `0x64`.
- **`math.max` resolves to `spinal.lib.math`** under `import spinal.lib._`; use `scala.math.max`.
- **Run one `mill` invocation at a time** — parallel invocations contend on the mill server and time out.
- **Trust the mill build, not metals diagnostics** (metals lags after new files/imports).

## 7. Multi-qubit fmax/area: DSP-spill into LUTs, and the `KEEP_HIERARCHY` fix

Scaling `PulseTableSoc` to many qubits (14) exposed a **synthesis-flow** trap that looks like the design
is too big for the part but isn't. Read this before benching/scaling any DSP-heavy multi-instance SoC.

### 7.1 Symptom
At 14 qubits the OOC synth reports **439k LUT (103% of the `xczu49dr`)** and `place_design` **fails**
(`[Place 30-99] Placer could not place all instances`, 460k LUT > 425k capacity). Vivado also warns
**`[Synth 8-3323] Resources of type DSP have been overutilized. Used = 5082, Available = 4272`** — yet
the final report shows only **2896 DSP used (68%)**, leaving 1376 DSPs idle while LUTs overflow. fmax
also "drops" (442 MHz, critical path in `ComplexMul`'s `m2` recombination carry chain) vs the 2-qubit
~555 MHz (which was RISC-V-core-bound).

### 7.2 It is NOT linear-scaling or a real capacity limit — measure to prove it
Per-block synthesis is **perfectly linear** up to the DSP budget. A `PulseGenerator` is **81 DSP +
~3.2k LUT** at *both* N=2 and N=7 (187 DSP/core, ~16k LUT/core; no overflow warning). Linear
extrapolation → 14 q ≈ **2618 DSP / ~220k LUT**, which fits with margin (61% DSP, 52% LUT). So the
14-qubit blow-up is the *tool*, not the design. **Diagnose by:** (a) re-synth at smaller N and check
DSP/core is constant; (b) `report_utilization -hierarchical` — the same `PulseGenerator` module shows
~3.2k LUT at N≤7 but 6–11k at N=14 (and two identical instances diverge, e.g. 6k vs 11k, by allocation
order); (c) the RISC-V core is only **2.2k LUT (7% of total)** — the LUTs are 71% in the multiply-heavy
datapath, not the CPU.

### 7.3 Cause
Vivado infers multipliers in two passes: a naive count (~363 DSP-candidates/core) then Karatsuba
pre-adder packing into the DSP48E2 that reduces it to ~187/core. At N≤~11 the naive total stays under
4272, so packing runs and everything fits in DSP. At N=14 the naive total (~5082) **exceeds 4272**, so
the resource-balancer **preemptively spills ~2186 multiplies into LUTs** before the packing pass — even
though the packed design needs only ~2618 DSP. Hence 2896 DSP (under-shoot) + 103% LUT.

### 7.4 Fix — `KEEP_HIERARCHY` on the datapath **blocks** (not on `ComplexMul`)
Fence each DSP datapath Component so it synthesizes as a self-contained unit and packs its ComplexMuls
into DSP48E2s independently, before any global budget check:
```scala
case class PulseGenerator(...) extends Component {
  this.addAttribute("KEEP_HIERARCHY", "TRUE")   // likewise ReadoutDecoder
```
Measured at 14 q (default synth flow, two-clock XDC):

| N=14 approach | LUT | DSP | DSP-overutil warn | fmax | crit path | fits? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| default (flatten) | 438k (103%) | 2896 | yes | 442* | ComplexMul `m2` | **no — place fails** |
| `KEEP_HIERARCHY` on **ComplexMul** | 388k (91%) | 3543 | yes | 399 | ComplexMul `m2` | marginal |
| **`KEEP_HIERARCHY` on datapath blocks** | **216k (51%)** | **3066 (72%)** | **no** | **539** | **RISC-V core** | **yes** |
| global `-flatten_hierarchy none` | 214k (50%) | 2618 | no | core-bound | — | yes |

(*442 MHz was a congestion artifact of the bloated netlist.) The block-level fence **matches the global
`-flatten_hierarchy none`** on area, fits with headroom, and restores fmax to ~539 MHz with the path
back inside the RISC-V core — but is *surgical* (top level and cores still flatten/optimize normally).

### 7.5 Why NOT `ComplexMul`, and NOT routing
- **Fence at `ComplexMul` is worse on every axis** (388k LUT, 3543 DSP, 399 MHz). The efficient
  3-DSP/lane packing needs Vivado to **retime the enclosing PulseGenerator's pipeline registers *into*
  the DSP48E2** (pre-adder reg / CREG / M-reg). A fence at the `ComplexMul` boundary cuts straight
  through that pipeline, so the registers can't fold in — pre-adds/`m2` spill to LUT and paths lengthen.
  The fence must enclose the **whole DSP pipeline + its registers** ⇒ the datapath block, not the mul.
- **Routing/implementation does NOT recover it.** This is a *synthesis* mapping decision: `opt_design`
  only trims ~5% (438k→418k via LUT-combining); it can never move a multiply back into a DSP. Don't run
  place&route hoping the LUTs shrink — fix the synthesis fence.

### 7.6 Bench implication
`PulseTableSocVivadoBench` uses the **default** synth flow (no `-flatten_hierarchy none`), so it reports
honest multi-qubit numbers **only because** these blocks now carry `KEEP_HIERARCHY`. Without the fence
the bench over-reports LUT ~2× and shows an artificial DSP-datapath critical path. (`KEEP_HIERARCHY` is
synthesis-only — no functional effect; the standalone sims/goldens and the standalone P6/R4 fmax benches
are unaffected, the datapath packs to its usual ~97 DSP/3k LUT.)

### 7.7 The fence costs DSP — `KEEP_HIERARCHY` blocks cross-boundary dead-output elimination
The block fence fits, but it uses **more DSP** than `-flatten_hierarchy none` (7.4: 3066 vs 2618 = +448 =
14 cores × 2 drives × 16). This is **not** a packing difference — it's **dead-code elimination across the
fence**. The mechanism, pinned by per-instance synthesis (a standalone `PulseGenerator` is **97 DSP** in
*both* flatten modes — so it is **not** a "denser template" effect; the lean **81** appears only in SoC
context):

- The SoC routes only the **real** pulse lane to the DAC (`RiscqRf…dac(0) := pg.io.pulse.payload`;
  `PulseTableSoc.dacMap` uses `_.re`), so each `PulseGenerator`'s `io.pulse.payload(k).im` is **dead**.
- The envelope `ComplexMul` is a 3-DSP Karatsuba: shared `M`, real-output mult `PRE`, imag-output mult
  `PIM`. With the imag output dead, Vivado prunes `PIM` ⇒ each `envMul` is **2 DSP**, −16/PulseGenerator
  (the carrier ComplexMuls stay 3 — both their outputs feed the envelope mult).
- **`-flatten_hierarchy none` (soft boundary) propagates this pruning across the `PulseGenerator`
  boundary; the hard `KEEP_HIERARCHY` fence blocks it** (it forbids optimization that depends on what's
  unused *outside* the block), so the fence keeps all 3 DSP.

**Fix — kill the dead output at the source, not at the fence:** `PulseGeneratorParams.realOutput` (default
false; set true by `RiscqRfWithPulseTableFiber.mkDrive`) drives `io.pulse.im := 0` **inside**
`PulseGenerator`. The dead output is then **intra-block**, so Vivado prunes `PIM` by ordinary intra-block
DCE **even under the fence** (verified: a standalone `PulseGenerator` with `im := 0` drops 97 → **81 DSP**,
each `envMul` 2 DSP, under default flatten). This is strictly better than relying on `-flatten none`'s
cross-boundary pruning: **keep the `KEEP_HIERARCHY` fence** (so the §7.4 LUT-spill protection stays) **and**
get the lean DSP count — 14 q ≈ **2618 DSP @ ~539 MHz**. It needs **no `ComplexMul` change**.

`realOutput` is opt-in because the carrier ComplexMuls and the `ReadoutDecoder`/demod genuinely need both
I and Q (and a future IQ-DAC path would too); the standalone `PulseGenerator` keeps the full complex
output. Bit-exactness: `PulseGeneratorSim` adds a `realOutput=true` run asserting the **real lane is
identical to the full-complex golden** and the imag lane is 0 — the optimization removes only dead logic.

**General lesson:** a `KEEP_HIERARCHY` fence preserves *unused* logic that the surrounding context would
otherwise let synthesis delete. If you fence a block for DSP-packing reasons, also make sure its outputs
are all actually consumed — or tie the dead ones off **inside** the block so intra-block DCE still fires.

## 8. Taking the SoC to real ZCU216 hardware (`vivado-scripts/`)

The maintained Vivado flows for `PulseTableSoc` on the `xczu49dr` (built with the `vivado` on `PATH`,
currently 2026.1) are **`riscvsoc-bd/`** (block
design + IP packager, mirrors RISC-Q `gen-project.sh`) and the **`riscvsoc/`** OOC place&route bench. An
earlier **flat** flow (flat RTL with the PS/RFDC as SpinalHDL blackboxes, top `Zcu216TopFlat`) was
removed; its generator `Zcu216TopFlat` and the design lessons below (8.2 / 8.4 / 8.5) are kept for
reference. The non-obvious bits hit while writing them:

### 8.1 The `vivado=true` flag must stay opt-in — it renames the host clock
**Symptom:** adding `X_INTERFACE_INFO` for the IP packager also wants `hostCd.renamePulledWires("hostClk",
"hostRst")`, which renames the top-level `clk` port → and immediately breaks `PulseTableSocVivadoBench`,
whose XDC does `create_clock … [get_ports clk]`.
**Fix:** gate *all* of it behind `PulseTableSoc(vivado = false)` (default). `GenPulseTableSocVivado` sets it
true; every sim/bench keeps the plain `clk`. The attributes themselves are sim-neutral (pure Verilog
attributes) — it is only the rename that bites.

### 8.2 None of the Xilinx AXI fabrics work outside a block design (for a routed 1→N)
**Symptom:** "use an AXI Interconnect instead of SmartConnect, since SmartConnect needs a BD." But
`create_ip xilinx.com:ip:axi_interconnect:2.1` errors *"only supported in IP Integrator"*, and the classic
**v1.7** — though it *does* `create_ip` standalone — doesn't expose `NUM_MASTER_PORTS` / per-master
`M0x_A00_BASE_ADDR` via Tcl in 2024.2 (the params simply don't exist on the IP).
**Fix:** build the fan-out in **SpinalHDL** (`Axi4CrossbarFactory`) inside the flat top (`Zcu216TopFlat`).
It *is* an AXI interconnect, just SpinalHDL-generated, and keeps the flat top truly block-design-free.
SmartConnect is fine in the block-design flow (`riscvsoc-bd`) because that flow *is* a block design.

### 8.3 ZynqMP `zynq_ultra_ps_e` has **no** DDR / FIXED_IO fabric ports
Unlike Zynq-7000's `processing_system7` (DDR_* / FIXED_IO_* inout buses you must thread to the top), the
UltraScale+ PS keeps DDR + MIO on dedicated PSU pins — with `PSU__USE__M_AXI_GP2 + FPGA_PL0` the IP's
instantiation template is just `maxihpm0_lpd_aclk`, the `maxigp2` AXI master, `pl_clk0`, `pl_resetn0`. So
the flat top needs **zero** `inout(Analog(...))` passthrough — a big simplification over what Zynq-7000
would require. (Confirm any IP's real port list from its Vivado `.veo` instantiation template — don't
hand-guess widths.)

### 8.4 `Axi4SpecRenamer` makes a SpinalHDL `Axi4` blackbox bind to Xilinx flat ports for free
Name the blackbox bundle `maxigp2` and call `Axi4SpecRenamer(maxigp2)`: SpinalHDL emits leaf ports
`maxigp2_awaddr` / `maxigp2_awvalid` / `maxigp2_awuser` / … — exactly the PS's port names, so the blackbox
binds by name with no per-signal `setName`. Match the `Axi4Config` to the IP (`useRegion = false`,
`awUserWidth = 16`, etc.) so the renamed signal *set* is identical (extra/missing ports = bind failure).

### 8.5 `Axi4CrossbarFactory` requires `master.idWidth ≤ every slave.idWidth`
**Symptom:** `assertion failed: Expect … idWidth=16 <= … idWidth=2` — the PS master is 16-bit id, the SoC
control port is `Axi4(32,32,2)`.
**Fix:** `Axi4IdRemover(ps.maxigp2)` before the crossbar (id 16 → 0; it stores + echoes the original id).
Trade-off: it serialises outstanding host transactions — fine for the low-rate PS control/config path, and
the only clean option short of widening the SoC's fixed id width.

### 8.6 Keep the TCL proc-free with `source`d includes
The block-design driver (`riscvsoc-bd/flow-bd.tcl`) sets script-scope config vars then `source`s ordered
`inc/*.tcl` steps; because nothing runs inside a `proc`, every step sees `$TOP`/`$ZYNQ_PS`/`$RFDC_TARGET`/…
at global scope — no `global` declarations, no thread-the-variable-through-every-proc tax that the RISC-Q
`riscq-project.tcl` pays. `inc/rfdc-config.tcl` writes to `$RFDC_TARGET` (`[get_bd_cells …]` for the BD;
the indirection once also served the flat flow's `[get_ips …]`).

### 8.7 riscvsoc-bd: synth args set on `synth_1` do NOT reach the cores — the IP synthesises OOC
**Symptom:** set `STEPS.SYNTH_DESIGN.ARGS.<anything>` (control-set threshold, strategy, GLOBAL_RETIMING)
on `synth_1` in the block-design flow and re-run → the result is **byte-identical**; `report_utilization`
shows the same LUT/FF/control-set counts. The Vivado GUI even confirms the property *is* set on `synth_1`.
**Cause:** in a block design the whole `PulseTableSoc` (all 14 cores) is packaged as a **user IP**
(`create_bd_cell -type ip … user.org:user:PulseTableSoc:1.0 top`, bd-build.tcl) and a user IP inside a BD
**synthesises out-of-context in its own child run** — here `riscq_bd_top_0_synth_1` (=`${BD_NAME}_top_0_synth_1`).
`synth_1` only synthesises the BD *wrapper* (PS/RFDC/SmartConnect stitch — ≈no core FFs), so every arg you
put on `synth_1` is applied to a run that doesn't contain the logic you care about. (This is also why a BD
synthesises the user IP at ~default LUT despite `synth_1` carrying `Flow_PerfOptimized_high`: the perf
strategy never reached the cores either.) Confirm the split with `find … -name '*.runs'`: the BD has a
`riscq_bd_top_0_synth_1` child run alongside `synth_1`. (A flat top — cores included — would instead be
`synth_1` itself, so there `synth_1` args DO apply.)
**Fix:** set the arg on the **IP OOC run**, not `synth_1`. Subtlety: that run **does not exist** when
`run.tcl` executes — Vivado materialises the BD's OOC child runs only *at* `launch_runs` (it both creates
and launches them in one step; `generate_target all` does NOT create the run objects, so a bare
`get_runs … *_top_*` returns empty and warns). Create them first with `create_ip_run` — the exact idiom
Vivado's own `scripts/project/synth_bd.tcl` uses (`create_ip_run [get_files $bd]`) — then set the property:
```tcl
if {[llength [set bd [get_files -quiet $BD_NAME.bd]]]} { catch { create_ip_run $bd } }
foreach r [get_runs -quiet -filter {IS_SYNTHESIS && NAME =~ *_top_*}] {
  set_property STEPS.SYNTH_DESIGN.ARGS.CONTROL_SET_OPT_THRESHOLD $N $r
}
launch_runs synth_1 -jobs 8   ;# now launches the already-created, already-configured IP run
```
`create_project -force` (create-project.tcl) rebuilds the project fresh each run, so the IP run is new and
re-synthesises with the arg — no stale-cache trap. The `RISCQ_CSET_THRESH` / `RISCQ_IP_RETIMING` knobs in
`riscvsoc-bd/inc/run.tcl` do exactly this. (A flat top would instead carry the cores in `synth_1`, where
`synth_1` args apply directly.)
