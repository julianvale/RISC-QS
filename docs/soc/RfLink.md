# RfLink — the down-link payload, pipe, and demux

**Source:** `src/riscq/soc/link/RfLink.scala` (the `RfCmd` bundle) and `object RfLink` in
`src/riscq/soc/link/RfLinkBridge.scala` (the `pipe`/`demux` helpers) · **Package:** `riscq.soc.link` ·
**Type:** Bundle + helper object

The narrow, one-way, posted core→DSP path itself: the `RfCmd` write bundle, the `RegNext` pipe that spans
distance, and the address demux that fans the single stream to each converter-edge channel. The
[RfLinkBridge](RfLinkBridge.md) produces the stream; the buffers ([PulseParamBuffer](PulseParamBuffer.md))
consume it.

## `RfCmd` — one posted RF register write

```scala
case class RfCmd(addrWidth: Int) extends Bundle {
  val address = UInt(addrWidth bits)   // byte offset within the RF window
  val data    = Bits(32 bits)          // the CPU's 32-bit store word
}
```

A single 32-bit store, decoded by the far-side channel exactly as the old `SlaveFactory` did (16-bit
fields packed at bit 16). Carried in a `Flow`, so **no ack on this path** — the bridge terminated the
CPU's TileLink D channel locally. This is the whole reason the link can be pipelined to any length:
nothing on it waits for a reply.

## `RfLink.pipe` — spanning distance

```scala
def pipe[T <: Data](flow: Flow[T], depth: Int): Flow[T]
```

Adds `depth` plain `RegNext` stages to a posted stream (`depth = 0` is identity). This is the
**timing-insensitive long-haul link**: every stage is an ordinary register, so the placer can stretch it
across the die. `depth` is the per-direction `linkPipe` knob (default 4) — more stages buy more physical
distance / timing slack between the core and the converters at the cost of a constant, predictable latency
that the lead-time scheduler absorbs (see [RfLinkBridge](RfLinkBridge.md) and [ARCH](ARCH.md) §2). Because
nothing on the path is timing-critical, the depth never needs to be tuned for fmax — only for floorplan
reach.

> In `RiscqRfWithPulseTableFiber` the actual stages are built by a local `getPipe` that also tags each
> `RegNext` `DONT_TOUCH` so the placer cannot collapse the chain; `RfLink.pipe` is the plain version used
> in the sims. Same shape, same posted semantics.

## `RfLink.demux` — fan to one sub-window

```scala
def demux(cmd: Flow[RfCmd], base: BigInt, size: BigInt, outWidth: Int): Flow[RfCmd]
```

Routes the bridge's single ordered stream to one channel's address window: the output is valid only when
the address falls in `[base, base+size)`, and is **rebased** to that window (the low `outWidth` bits). It
is **pure combinational routing — no arbiter, no collision**, because a `Flow` has no back-pressure and the
far-side channels are independent (each only reacts to addresses in its own window). The per-core fiber
demuxes the `0x40000` RF window into four `0x10000` sub-windows: gate drive `@0x0`, readout drive
`@0x10000`, demod carrier `@0x20000`, readout decoder `@0x30000`.

## Latency / timing

`pipe(·, d)` adds exactly `d` cycles; `demux` is combinational (0 cycles). Every register is a plain
`RegNext` with no enable and no feedback — there is no critical path to close on the link.

## Verification

No dedicated sim — the pipe and demux are exercised inside the link sims: `RfLinkBridgeSim` asserts the
demux routes each beat to the correct rebased sub-window, and `ReadoutResultLinkSim` sweeps the pipe over
`linkPipe ∈ {0, 4, 16}` to show the path is distance-tolerant (the result is bit-exact at every depth).

```bash
mill runMain riscq.soc.sim.RfLinkBridgeSim
mill runMain riscq.soc.sim.ReadoutResultLinkSim
```
