/**
 * Demodulating readout integrator — the inverse of the [[PulseGenerator]], '''triggered by the demod
 * carrier's window''' instead of a software-armed one. For every incoming ADC batch it
 * '''demodulates''' against the reference carrier (the demod LO), '''integrates''' the product across
 * the lanes and across the window, and emits the integrated I/Q point plus a one-bit discrimination:
 *
 * {{{
 *   demod[t][k] = adc[t][k] · carrier[t][k]            // complex × complex, per lane  (down-conversion)
 *   real/imag   = Σ_{t ∈ window} Σ_k demod[t][k]        // integrated I / Q
 *   res         = sign(real)                            // threshold 0 on the real axis
 * }}}
 *
 * '''The carrier defines the window.''' `io.carrier` is a `Flow`: its `valid` is exactly the scheduled
 * demod-pulse window (the [[PulseGenerator]]'s `activeReg`, high for `[startTime, startTime + dur)`),
 * and its payload is forced to zero outside that window. So the decoder needs no `io.time`, no
 * `startTime`, no `dur`, and no window FSM — it watches the carrier valid:
 *   - '''rising edge''' → restart the accumulator (load the first in-window product);
 *   - '''falling edge''' → the integral is complete → raise `res.valid`;
 *   - in between it just accumulates — and it accumulates '''every cycle''', because an idle carrier
 *     contributes an exactly-zero product (§2.5 of `specs/new-readout-decoder`), so the free-running
 *     `sum` simply holds its settled value between windows.
 *
 * '''Reused, verified blocks''': the per-lane demod is `riscq.dsp.ComplexMul` (the same DSP48-packed,
 * II = 1 product the pulse side uses); the lane sum is the balanced [[AdderTree]]
 * (`reduceBalancedTree(_ + _, RegNext)`).
 *
 * '''Derived window alignment (no magic numbers)''' — the carrier `valid` is delayed by
 * `Ldemod = ComplexMul.latency + 1 + log2Up(N)` cycles (adc/carrier input → tree output) so its edges
 * arrive at the accumulator aligned with the corresponding tree output. The integrated batches are then
 * '''exactly''' the carrier's in-window batches, `dur` of them; ADC/analog-path delay is absorbed into
 * when software fires the demod pulse (no decoder-side `timeOffset`).
 *
 * `res.valid` rises once the integral has settled (the SoC halts the readback bus until then) and stays
 * high until the next window's `winStart` clears it, i.e. it is low exactly during the next window's
 * integration; the SoC forwards it up the link as a level. `demodData` streams the raw per-batch demod
 * (for trace/averaging), valid aligned with its own payload.
