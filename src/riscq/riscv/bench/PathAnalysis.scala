/**
 * Static pre-synthesis path analysis of the **riscq RISC-V core**, a thin entry point over the
 * generic [[riscq.bench.PathAnalysis]] engine.
 *
 * With no args it prints the longest register -> register combinational paths and the largest
 * fanouts (the classic fmax-tuning view). Pass two signal names to instead report, between those two
 * signals, both the register levels (pipeline latency, in clock cycles) and the combinational levels
 * (logic depth, in computational operators) — complementary views of how far apart they sit.
 *
 * Run:
 *   ./.metals/mill runMain riscq.riscv.bench.PathAnalysis                 # longest paths + fanout
 *   ./.metals/mill runMain riscq.riscv.bench.PathAnalysis <from> <to>     # register + combinational levels
