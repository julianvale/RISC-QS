/**
 * The optional RV32 **M** multiply unit: `MUL`, `MULH`, `MULHSU`, `MULHU`.
 *
 * riscq has a single execute stage, so — like the LSU — this plugin lives at `executeAt` and
 * **halts** the stage for a fixed number of cycles while a small internal pipeline computes the
 * product, then fires. It is its own `FiberPlugin`, gated by `RiscqParam.withMul`, and contributes
 * nothing to the RV32I datapath beyond one registered rd-write source (`WriteBackPlugin.addRdSource`).
 *
 * **Datapath.** Each 32-bit operand is sign-extended to a 33-bit signed value (so one signed
 * 33×33 → 64-bit multiply covers all four ops: MUL keeps the low word, the MULH* group the high
 * word). The product is built from four partial products, each sized to fit a single Xilinx
 * **27×18 DSP**: every operand is split into a low (17-bit, → 18-bit signed non-negative) and a
 * high (16-bit signed) chunk, with `op = hi·2^17 + lo` exactly. The four chunk multiplies are
 * registered (one cycle), then their `2^0 / 2^17 / 2^34` weighted sum is folded into the 64-bit
 * product across **two** further cycles — a two-level adder tree split over a register, so no single
 * cycle chains all three additions (that one-cycle accumulate was timing-critical; see the sum block).
 * Three-cycle latency ⇒ a 3-cycle bubble per multiply, trading IPC for timing.
 *
 * This is the depth-1 stripping of VexiiRiscv's `MulPlugin` (no multi-lane, no `MulSpliter`
 * generality, no `rsUnsignedPlugin`, no 64-bit MULW).
